<p><strong>How to create an issue in Github:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Under your repository name, click <strong>Issues</strong>, click <strong>New Issue</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose an Issue template, click <strong>Get started</strong></p>

<h3>Steps for making changes and creating Pull request<a class="headerlink" href="#steps-for-making-changes-and-creating-pull-request" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After finding an issue you are working on, you will start making changes:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Fork</strong></p>
<p>Fork the project on Github and clone your fork locally.</p>
<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$  git clone https://github.com:username/UnifiedHMI.git
$  <span class="nb">cd</span> UHMI
$  git remote add upstream https://github.com/UnifiedHMI/UnifiedHMI.git
$  git fetch upstream
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 2: Branch</strong></p>
<p>To keep your development environment organized, create local branches to hold your work. These should be branched directly off of the main branch.</p>
<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git checkout -b my-branch -t upstream/main
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 3: Code</strong></p>
<p>Contributor need to follow some modifying rules as below:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Do not include non-opensource or non-public source code.</li>
<li>There are no internal comments and references to other non-public sources.</li>
<li>Coding style need to be consistent in UHMI project.</li>
<li>When you want to create a new source code file, make sure <strong>Copyright</strong> notices and <strong>License</strong> notices must be commended in the start of file.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4: Commit​</strong></p>
<p>It is recommended to keep your changes grouped logically within individual commits. Many contributors find it easier to review changes that are split across multiple commits. There is no limit to the number of commits in a pull request.
A good commit message should describe what changed and why.
Link Github issue to commit message follow syntax: #&lt;issue number&gt;</p>
<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git add my/changed/files
$ git commit
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 5: Rebase​</strong></p>
<p>Once you have committed your changes, it is a good idea to use git rebase (not git merge) to synchronize your work with the main repository.</p>
<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git fetch upstream
$ git rebase upstream/main
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This ensures that your working branch has the latest changes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Push​</strong></p>
<p>Once your commits are ready to go – with passing tests and linting – begin the process of opening a pull request by pushing your working branch to your fork on Github.</p>
<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git push origin my-branch
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 7: Opening the Pull Request​</strong></p>
<p>From within Github, opening a new pull request will present you with a template that should be filled out:</p>
<img alt="Create Pull Request" src="/_images/createPQ.PNG" />
<p>Link Github issue to Pull request description follow syntax: #&lt;issue number&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Discuss and update​</strong></p>
<p>You will probably get feedback or requests for changes to your pull request. This is a big part of the submission process so don’t be discouraged! Some contributors may sign off on the pull request right away. Others may have detailed comments or feedback. This is a necessary part of the process in order to evaluate whether the changes are correct and necessary.</p>
<p>To make changes to an existing pull request, make the changes to your local branch, add a new commit with those changes, and push those to your fork. GitHub will automatically update the pull request.</p>
<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ git add my/changed/files
$ git commit
$ git push origin my-branch
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>There are a number of more advanced mechanisms for managing commits using git rebase that can be used, but are beyond the scope of this guide.</p>
<p>Feel free to post a comment in the pull request to ping reviewers if you are awaiting an answer on something.</p>
<p>All pull requests require approval from a Code Owner of the area you modified in order to land. Whenever a maintainer reviews a pull request they may request changes. These may be small, such as fixing a typo, or may involve substantive changes. Such requests are intended to be helpful, but at times may come across as abrupt or unhelpful, especially if they do not include concrete suggestions on how to change them.</p>
<p>Try not to be discouraged. If you feel that a review is unfair, say so or seek the input of another project contributor. Often such comments are the result of a reviewer having taken insufficient time to review and are not ill-intended. Such difficulties can often be resolved with a bit of patience. That said, reviewers should be expected to provide helpful feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9: Merging​</strong></p>
<p>In order to land, a pull request needs to be reviewed and approved by at least one UHMI Code Owner. After that, if there are no objections from other contributors, the pull request can be merged.</p>
<p>Congratulations and thanks for your contribution!</p>
