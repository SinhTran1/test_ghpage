About
*****

This manual describes the Yocto development environment used in Unified HMI project and AGL (Automotive Grade Linux).

**NOTE:** This entire section presumes you want to build an image. The supported images exist for several boards as well as for the Quick EMUlator (QEMU). In this manual, we will guide how to build an image and run on QEMU virtual machine.

Setup development PC
********************
Preparing your build host so that it can build an AGL image means making sure your system is set up to use the Yocto Project OpenEmbedded build system, which is based on BitBake.

This section presents minimal information so you can prepare the build host to use the "Dunfell" version of the Yocto Project (i.e. version 3.1.2).

- The recommand building hosts are: Ubuntu-20.04
- Be Sure Your Build Host Has Enough Free Disk Space: Your build host should have at least 100 Gbytes.
- Your Build Host should have 8GB RAM or greater.
- Git 1.8.3.1 or greater
- Tar 1.27 or greater
- Python 3.4.0 or greater

Downloading AGL Software
************************

Download the AGL Source Files
-----------------------------

How to download AGL steps, you can refer `this link <https://docs.automotivelinux.org/en/master/#0_Getting_Started/2_Building_AGL_Image/2_Downloading_AGL_Software/>`_.

Directory structure after downloading
-------------------------------------

Listing out the resulting directory structure appears as follows:

    ├── external
    ├── meta-agl
    ├── meta-agl-demo
    ├── meta-agl-devel
    ├── meta-rvgpu

- meta-agl: Minimal set of software needed to create an AGL distribution used to boot a system.
- meta-agl-demo: Provides a reference or demo platform and applications for the AGL Distribution. The reference UI is part of the meta-agl-demo layer.
- meta-agl-devel: Contains components under development or being tested. This layer also contains software packages that OEMs need but do not exist in AGL.
- meta-rvgpu: UHMI layer for AGL Yocto project building.
- Bsp: Provides support for specified platforms (renesas, raspberrypi…) for use with OpenEmbedded and/or Yocto.
- External: This layer contains poky and other Yocto Project Compatible layers that inclusion of technologies, hardware components, and software components: clang, security...
